# Ecosia Idle

This extension searches on Ecosia behind the scenes so that you don't have to compromise search quality to be ecofriendly. Everytime you search for something on Google, DuckDuckGo, Yahoo Search, or Bing, a background request is made to Ecosia's own search engine. It happens seemlessly, with no detrimental effect on your browsing experience or habits.
